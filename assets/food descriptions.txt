Crunchwrap Supremes® are so hot right now.

But they weren’t always living the best life. They too had their rough patches as we all may have had. But one day, the Crunchwrap had enough and had to show everyone who was boss.

It knew what it wanted and it knows it’s hot. But hey, flaunt it if you got it, right? The Crunchwrap never gets a bad rap, though, because it’s the leader of the pack. It gets the respect it rightfully deserves and it never sells itself short. It knows it can take anything thrown its way.

Fresh, hand-cut potatoes prepared in 100% sunflower oil. 
Quality you can taste.
From the first bite of your burger to your last french fry, quality is the most important ingredient at In-N-Out Burger. We don’t freeze, pre-package or microwave our food.

We make things the old-fashioned way.
Our commitment to quality starts with our hamburgers. And our burgers begin with our patties. Each patty is made using only fresh, individually inspected, whole chucks from premium cattle selected especially for In-N-Out Burger. Our team of Associates removes the bones, grinds the meat and then makes each patty.

We have always made our hamburger patties ourselves using only fresh, 100% USDA ground chuck — free of additives, fillers and preservatives. We deliver them to our stores direct from our own patty-making facilities in Baldwin Park, California; Lathrop, California; and Dallas, Texas. We control the whole process, so we can be certain of the quality and freshness of every patty we make.

Our commitment to quality doesn’t stop there. All of our ingredients are delivered fresh to our stores. In fact, we don’t even own a microwave, heat lamp, or freezer. Our iceberg lettuce is hand-leafed. Our American cheese is the real thing. And we use the best available onions and the plumpest, juiciest tomatoes we can find. Our buns are baked using old-fashioned, slow-rising sponge dough. And we make every burger one at a time, cooked fresh to order.

Of course a great burger deserves great fries. At In-N-Out, french fries come from the finest, freshest potatoes. They’re shipped right from the farm, individually cut in our stores, and then cooked in 100% sunflower oil. Our shakes are just as genuine — made with real ice cream. At In-N-Out, that’s the only way we’ll ever make them. Because when you like to keep things simple, doing things the old-fashioned way is the freshest idea of all.

Some believe its use in Sichuan cooking is to numb the senses enough to allow one to eat even more chilies.

Strange flavor is one of those iconic flavor profiles that linger on your mind and tastebuds long after you’ve had it. It’s complex, balanced and somehow works drizzled on almost any canvas.
 
It is so named because of the strangely alluring blend of sweet, spicy, savoury, nutty and numbing elements. No single flavor overwhelms another, somehow working in perfect unison. The most common way to eat this sauce is over poached and shredded chicken breast but once you master the flavor balance you can really apply it over anything. I love to dress up poke/ceviche with it and eat it inside lettuce wraps.
Mapo tofu is definitely one of those ‘last meal’ dishes I don’t think I could ever tire of. This version, made with shiitake mushroom instead of the usual pork or beef, is actually one of the deepest, most flavorful I’ve ever had. The real secret is of course, is once again the doubanjiang.
Kungpao is probably one of the most famous flavor profiles in Sichuan cuisine, it is characterized by a nice balance of spicy, savoury, sour and sweet. The sauce is versatile and can be applied to many canvases, most famously on chicken. I’ve made everything from Kungpao venison, to pastrami, to tofu, but the version I most frequently make is tiger shrimp, because of how fast they are to make.
Two skewers of shrimp brushed with a buttery garlic glaze for extra flavor. Served with your choice of two sides.

Named after the chef who masterminded the perfect breading for this dish and others, these large shrimp are butterflied, hand-breaded and fried until perfectly golden crisp. There’s a reason they’ve been a menu staple since 1996.

How does Jack beef up the American classic B.L.T.? By adding a C.B. A cheeseburger, that is. You get a tasty, full-size cheeseburger made with hickory smoked bacon, two slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and real mayonnaise —all on a buttery bakery bun. Now that’s a R.R.T.B.T.A.H.T.B.R.R.H. (really, really tasty burger that also happens to be really, really huge).
You claim you’re not hungry, but that’s before you read about a 100% beef patty topped with bacon, tomato, Swiss-style cheese, real mayonnaise, and ketchup—all on toasted sourdough bread. One more time for emphasis. Toasted. Sourdough. Bread. See? Now you’re hungry.

Melted garlic herb butter on a juicy ¼ lb.* beef patty. Need we say more? Nay. But we will anyway. Because this beautiful burger has all the fixins’—provolone cheese, creamy tomato sauce, green leaf lettuce, and fresh sliced tomatoes, all on a Gourmet Signature Bun. Need we say more? Nay. For real, this time. 
This isn’t just a burger. This is a Declaration of Delicious. Two juicy, 100% beef patties with American cheese, fresh sliced tomatoes, hand leafed lettuce, and real mayonnaise—all on a buttery bakery bun. Yeah, Great Britain wishes they could get their hands on this amazing piece of America.

Can a cheeseburger change the world? Nah. Don’t be silly. But an Ultimate Cheeseburger? With two beef patties, American and Swiss-style cheeses, real mayonnaise, mustard, and ketchup on a buttery bakery bun? That can change the world, alright. And maybe Mars. And perhaps that planet with the cool rings around it.

How do you make an Ultimate Cheeseburger—with two beef patties, American and Swiss-style cheese, real mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, all on a buttery bakery bun—even more ultimate? You add three slices of bacon. You read that correctly. Three. Whoever coined “three’s a crowd” has obviously never had this burger.

This is the cheeseburger other cheeseburgers have posters of in their bedrooms. A 100% beef patty topped with two slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, chopped onions, real mayonnaise, and ketchup on a Buttery Bakery Bun. Now, you want a poster too, huh?

Anywhere else this Jr. Jack would be senior. Because there is nothing junior about this honest-to-goodness beef patty topped with tomato, pickle, lettuce, and chopped onions—with the just-right amount of ketchup and real mayonnaise. But here? It’s got some growing up to do.

Bring the heat. Directly to your mouth. This inferno has it all—100% beef, hickory smoked bacon, sliced jalapeños, Swiss cheese, cool shredded lettuce, and fresh sliced tomatoes with spicy, creamy sriracha sauce, all on Jack’s signature toasty sourdough bread. Give your tastebuds a pep talk now, before it’s too late.

Why see double when you can eat triple? Our Triple Cheese & Bacon Curly Fries are made with savory bacon, crispy curly fries and smothered in three kinds of cheeses. That’s right. Three cheeses. We’d put four in, but I mean, that’s just crazy. Next thing you know, the whole world would get turned upside down. Cats would become friends with dogs. It’d be OK to wear white after Labor Day. Trust us. Three kinds of cheese is the perfect amount.

It’s time to get totally Sauced and extremely Loaded with the new Chili Cheese Curly Fries, made with all-beef chili and crispy curly fries all smothered in melted cheddar cheese.

Because these curly fries are everything you need to keep the party going all night.

These Curly Fries are seasoned, alright. Seasoned veterans. They’ve been around the block—gathering deliciousness and flavor from all over. So, they know how to make your mouth water. And your tastebuds do their secret handshake.

True love is not an engagement ring. It’s an onion ring—panko breaded and fried to jaw-dropping perfection. But using an onion ring as an engagement ring? The judge will allow it. Just kidding. There’s not a judge for this type thing. Do whatever your stomach desires.

It doesn’t get any better than golden brown potato wedges. Well, unless you add melted cheddar cheese sauce, shredded cheddar cheese, and diced bacon bits. Which is exactly what we did. Microphone, consider yourself dropped.

It’s what’s on the inside that counts. That goes for you, sure. But it definitely goes for these crispy egg rolls—filled with diced pork, cabbage, celery, carrots, onions, and spices. But don’t forget the outside, where there’s sweet and sour dipping sauce. You can’t go wrong, really.

Where most see jalapeños, Jack sees opportunity. To bread ‘em and fill ‘em with melted cheeses. Yes, plural. And, if things get too hot, there’s tasty buttermilk ranch dipping sauce to cool down. Mmhmm. Jack’s got your back. And your stomach.

This is the taco that eats other tacos when it’s craving tacos. Because this large-and-in-charge, crunchy taco is topped with American cheese, shredded lettuce and taco sauce. Uh, huh. You’ll want to sit down for this.

Bacon Ranch—but wait, it gets even better—Monster Taco. Yep, Bacon Ranch Monster Taco. Nothing beats a large Monster Taco topped with shredded lettuce, sliced bacon and creamy buttermilk ranch. Well, unless you order another one. You know, for the road.

When Jack put nacho cheese sauce and sliced jalapeños on an already-delicious monster taco, everybody yelled, “you’ve gone too far, Jack!” And then everybody took a bite of one, paused, and said, “never mind.”

Sure, one is nice. But do you know what’s better? Two. Two crunchy tacos with American cheese, shredded lettuce, and taco sauce. Because two will always be greater than one. Who knew math could be so mouth-watering? Oh, right. We did.
