Crunchwrap Supremes® are so hot right now.

But they weren’t always living the best life. They too had their rough patches as we all may have had. But one day, the Crunchwrap had enough and had to show everyone who was boss. Kicking it up a notch and really bringing that cravability of all its glorious layers into a single carry all. The Crunchwrap had that type of attitude that your mama warned you about. It knew what it wanted and it knows it’s hot. But hey, flaunt it if you got it, right? The Crunchwrap never gets a bad rap, though, because it’s the leader of the pack. It gets the respect it rightfully deserves and it never sells itself short. It knows it can take anything thrown its way.

Choose from a variety of our classic chicken-on-the-bone favorites.

Quality you can taste.
From the first bite of your burger to your last french fry, quality is the most important ingredient at In-N-Out Burger. We don’t freeze, pre-package or microwave our food.

We make things the old-fashioned way.
Our commitment to quality starts with our hamburgers. And our burgers begin with our patties. Each patty is made using only fresh, individually inspected, whole chucks from premium cattle selected especially for In-N-Out Burger. Our team of Associates removes the bones, grinds the meat and then makes each patty.

We have always made our hamburger patties ourselves using only fresh, 100% USDA ground chuck — free of additives, fillers and preservatives. We deliver them to our stores direct from our own patty-making facilities in Baldwin Park, California; Lathrop, California; and Dallas, Texas. We control the whole process, so we can be certain of the quality and freshness of every patty we make.

Our commitment to quality doesn’t stop there. All of our ingredients are delivered fresh to our stores. In fact, we don’t even own a microwave, heat lamp, or freezer. Our iceberg lettuce is hand-leafed. Our American cheese is the real thing. And we use the best available onions and the plumpest, juiciest tomatoes we can find. Our buns are baked using old-fashioned, slow-rising sponge dough. And we make every burger one at a time, cooked fresh to order.

Of course a great burger deserves great fries. At In-N-Out, french fries come from the finest, freshest potatoes. They’re shipped right from the farm, individually cut in our stores, and then cooked in 100% sunflower oil. Our shakes are just as genuine — made with real ice cream. At In-N-Out, that’s the only way we’ll ever make them. Because when you like to keep things simple, doing things the old-fashioned way is the freshest idea of all.
