slow-roasted ROAST BEEF
Our roast beef is 100% pure beef, free of additives, fillers, and preservatives. We marinate whole top 20-pound beef cuts, then slow-roast them up to 10 hours. 

Hand-Breaded Fried Chicken
Our chicken sandwiches are made with all-natural chicken breast that's been hand-breaded, and marinated in buttermilk & pickle brine. Each is then fried crispy  to order.  

hand-cut Curly Fries
Our curly fries are hand-cut into spirals from whole potatoes daily. They are fried in 100% beef fat to maximize flavor and enjoyment. I mean, you only live once.      

Creamy Frozen Custard
We make our frozen custard fresh in store each day. Our frozen custard is creamier than ice cream, and it ain't soft serve either. Be sure to save room for dessert!

WE THINK GOOD FOOD IS MADE FROM SCRATCH BY PEOPLE WHO CARE.  

We started Top Round because we wanted a place to get good, wholesome food, fast. Growing up in cities like St. Louis and Buffalo, we remember old school roast beef sandwiches– they tasted great, and they were never made from mystery meat.

We believe in going Back to Better. 
Here at Top Round, what you’re eating is real food, made in-store by folks who care. Each Top Round has a real kitchen. We prepare meats and veggies, cut french fries, and make sauces in that very kitchen.
